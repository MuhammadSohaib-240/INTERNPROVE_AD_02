# To-Do List App

## Description
This project is a simple To-Do List app developed for educational purposes to demonstrate the use of **MVVM architecture** with **Jetpack Compose** and **SQLite** local database using **Room**. The main goal of this project was to learn how to effectively connect an Android application to a local database.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Implement the **MVVM architecture** in an Android app to separate concerns and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- Use **Jetpack Compose** for building native UIs in a declarative and efficient manner.
- Integrate a local SQLite database using **Room** to store and manage data within the app.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks to update details.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from their list when completed or no longer needed.
- **View Tasks:** Tasks are displayed in a list format, allowing users to easily view and manage their to-do items.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Programming language used for building the app.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for creating the UI in a modern, declarative way.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a clear separation of concerns and helps with testability and maintainability.
- **Room**: Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

## Usage
This To-Do List app allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add, edit, delete, and view their tasks. The tasks are stored locally using Room, which provides a smooth experience even without internet access.

## Learning Outcomes
This project taught me how to:
- Properly implement MVVM architecture to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner.
- Utilize Jetpack Compose to create a modern and intuitive UI.
- Integrate and manage a local database using Room and SQLite.
- Understand the flow of data from the database to the UI and how to manage state changes effectively.
